## [v3.0](https://github.com/saulpw/visidata/releases/tag/v3.0) (2023-12-30)

This is a major release.

There have been several major improvements (sidebar, help panels, command palette), and a great many smaller improvements and bugfixes: over 1600 commits in the year since v2.11.

To put it to a word, 1.x was a library (apps welcome), 2.x was a platform (plugins welcome), and 3.x will be more like a product (apps and plugins included).

## Highlights

- The **sidebar** shows status messages as well as context-dependent help panels.
- **Help and guides** in more and more places: try `vd -P open-guide-index`.
- **Command palette**:  Press `Space` and fuzzy search for commands to execute.
- **Themes**: Try `vd --theme=light` or `vd --theme=asciimono`.
- **The kitchen sink**: most third-party plugins and [loaders](https://visidata.org/docs/formats) (including vdplus) are released with VisiData in the same package.

## Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0

Most things should just work.

- Run `vd2to3.vdx` to convert the internal list of macros from tsv to jsonl.
- Rename `{options.input_history}.jsonl` to `input_history.jsonl` (the option is deprecated and the name is no longer configurable).

There have been a few API changes that might require updates to plugins, or code in e.g. .visidatarc.
